# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Peer-graded Assignment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The files in this folder are: 
1) run_analysis.R - R script which shows how the final dataset has been computed
2) tidydata.csv - the required tidy data set 
3) CodeBook.md - code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4) README.md file
